# time-manager

A simple extension meant for tracking the time spent on different tasks. The goal is easily measure time spent on a single task. This should encourage deep work and prevent task switching.

The task switching should be frictionless and seamless to do. This will allow for an overview on what the time is spent on. The overview then allows you to reflect on what tasks are really valuable and how to start prioritizing them more.
